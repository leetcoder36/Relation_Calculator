# Relation_Calculator
A simple program based on set theory that takes an integer relation as an input and checks the relation for symmetry, antisymmetry, and transitivity

The program stores a series of ordered pairs in an ArrayList. It then traverses the list using a few simple algorithms to determine the properties of the relation
